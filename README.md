# m-bogaerts' dotfiles

This repository has several configuration files that I use in my personal computer. They are customised for me, but you can fork, improve or use them if you like.

It includes configuration of *zsh*, *oh-my-zsh* and the configuration.

## usage
In order to use this dotfiles, there is several scripts to make your (and mine) life easier.

### installation
To install the shell software, asdf and syncing the configuration, there is a script called `linux_install.sh` (or `osx_install.sh`) that execute commands to do all of these stuff.

**NOTE:** you may want to change the `.gitconfig` file on your local copy (or you will be doing commits with my name and e-mail address).
